Project repository for this forthcoming study in: Windzio, Michael, Helen Seitzer, Fabian Besche and Ivo Mossig. *Networks and Geographies of Global Social Policy Diffusion. Palgrave Macmillan.*

Our main findings are that nation state formation matters, functionalism should not be underestimated and that both network diffusion spatially and along trade networks were factors in the global introduction of work-injury laws and social insurance schemes.
